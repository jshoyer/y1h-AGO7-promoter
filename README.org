These files accompany a paper
that was published in Plant Direct:

Most of the files
are from high-throughput screens
done to identify direct upstream regulators of AGO7.

The script 2011-01_AGO-screens/figure1-etc.R
is the most important one for the paper.

2013-12-06/graphs-of-Dec-2013-data.R
compares signal for different TFs
tested against a single AGO7 promoter fragment.
It was used for Supplemental Figure S4 in the manuscript.

2014-08-04/graphs-of-Aug-2014-data.R
compares bait with SPL core binding sites deleted.
It was used for Figure 2D in the manuscript.

2014-07-24/graphs-of-July-2014-data.R
compares bait with TCP core binding sites deleted.
It was used for Figure 4 in the manuscript.

2014_Weirauch-etc/scanBothStrandsPlot.R
was used for Figure 2, panels B and C,
and Figure 3.
It uses six DNA-binding specificity models
downloaded from the CisBP database
(Weirauch et al. 2014).
That directory also includes output tables
from scanning AGO7, AGO1, and AGO10 upstream regions
with FIMO
using three sets of motifs
available in the online MEME suite.
