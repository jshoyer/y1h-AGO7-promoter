These files accompany a soon-to-be-submitted manuscript.
They are from a high-throughput screens
done to identify direct upstream regulators of AGO7.

The script 2011-01_AGO-screens/figure1-etc.R
is the most important one for the paper.

2013-12-06/graphs-of-Dec-2013-data.R
compares signal for different TFs
tested against a single AGO7 promoter fragment.
It was used for Supplemental Figure S4 in the manuscript.

2014-08-04/graphs-of-Aug-2014-data.R
compares bait with SPL core binding sites deleted.
It was used for Figure 2D in the manuscript.

2014-07-24/graphs-of-July-2014-data.R
compares bait with TCP core binding sites deleted.
It was used for Figure 4 in the manuscript.

2014_Weirauch-etc/scanBothStrandsPlot.R
was used for Figure 2, panels B and C,
and Figure 3.
It uses six DNA-binding specificity models
downloaded from the CisBP database
(Weirauch et al. 2014).
